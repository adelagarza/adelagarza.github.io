	<p>I am a non-traditional student, meaning I am "old" and not down for a kegger. I already have another degree and a previous "life". I'm expensively changing my path as I've had work experiences and aiming for a different direction. I am determined and I very much want to be successful and entirely happy with what I place in my life.</p>
	<p>I think I'm pretty cool though, for an "old" person. I enjoy reading a little about everything...meaning I COULD potentially go on Jeopardy. I thoroughly enjoy learning about people. I usually take away an aspect of their personality that I want to emmulate or that I admire. I am very introverted, but most people think I'm not. It's painful for me to be "social", yet I enjoy people, go figure. I'm obsessed with MBTI. I am an INFJ, the rarest type, 1% of the population.(<a href= "https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"> Take the test, life changing or your money back. It's free though. </a>). I try to be a "cool" mom. My kids can play XBOX and eat in their rooms, come on. Mainly, I am open for any type of coversation with them. I expect a lot from my kids, but I will gladly help guide them through the rough and difficult parts. Hindsight's 20/20 as they say. I always tell them that my job is to get their souls's back to Heaven and for them to be a successful and well-adjusted adult in the meantime.</p>
	<p>I have a LOT of work experience. I have been in fast food, retail, banking, mortgage, admin, call centers, medical facilities, door to door knife sales (Ha! Yes. It was awful), self-employed, and a nurse. Honestly, I don't even know what I want to do. I want to enjoy my life, love and be loved, have plenty of money to not worry about money and learn about people and their lives. Where is that job listed? <a href= "http://ultimateskills.net/images/nojobfound.jpg"> I'm running out of patience. </a> </body>
